## Introduction

[APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/#:~:text=on%20your%20phone.-,What%20does%20API%20stand%20for%3F,of%20service%20between%20two%20applications.) are the unseen backbone of every popular application 
we use daily. From apps on our smartphones to complex systems, APIs are the backstage bridges 
that connect everything, move information around and make our world work. As developers, we spend
a lot of time interacting with APIs. We build them, test them and integrate them into various 
client (and server) applications. 

So, is there a simple way to try new APIs that we’ve recently discovered, or even test APIs we’re 
currently developing? Yes! **API clients are specialized tools developers rely on to work with APIs 
during development and exploration.** It’s an indispensable part of our API workflows. However, with 
the plethora of options available, choosing the right tool for the job can be overwhelming.

In this blog post, let’s dive into a comparative analysis of four popular API clients: Bruno, 
Postman, Hoppscotch, and HTTPie. I’ll examine their strengths, features and the best cases to 
use them. I aim to equip you with the knowledge to select the best API client which aligns with 
your project requirements, team, and workflows. By the end, you should have a clear understanding 
of each tool’s advantages and disadvantages, enabling you to confidently choose what’s best for 
your project. Let’s begin with an overview, followed by a feature comparison, discuss strengths 
and weaknesses, explore use cases, and finally guide you on choosing the best tool for your 
project needs.

## Postman: The de facto popular API client

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) has been the industry standard for API development for over 
a decade. It has wide support for various API types (like REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC), including 
real-time APIs (like WebSocket). This API client really takes developers seriously and has a lot of
features and tools that helps us throughout the API lifecycle: documentation, testing, mocking,
monitoring, and sharing.

### Features

- A friendly UI that helps in sending requests and inspecting responses.
- [Collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/collections-overview/) that 
  help organise requests and documentation for better collaboration and reuse.
- **Postman Cloud** allows teams to collaborate and document APIs in workspaces. It also offers 
  centralised version control.
- [Documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/) tools
  for generating API documentation more easily.
- Support for **mocking** & **testing** APIs by creating [mock servers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)
  on the cloud.
- Support for [monitoring APIs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/)
  by setting up schedules and viewing monitoring results on the cloud.

Postman has a proprietary, centralized cloud-first platform designed for team collaboration, with 
workspaces to facilitate real-time sharing between team members. However, this 
[comes at a cost](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). 
The free plan of Postman Cloud is very limited in both the feature set and resource limits. 
To have the true team experience, you must upgrade to the Basic, Professional or Enterprise plans 
of Postman Cloud, which aren’t free.

## HTTPie: The CLI-based API client

[HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) is a simple yet powerful command-line API testing client. It mainly
focuses on providing a user-friendly command-line experience for making HTTP requests. It's designed
for simplicity and readability in the terminal. It's primarily designed for individual use and shell
scripting, with collaboration usually involving the sharing of scripts or commands (via your favorite
collaboration system). It has no built-in cloud or collaboration features.

### Features

- Completetly CLI-based operations. This makes it easy to integrate into shell scripting and automation.
- Intuitive syntax for constructing HTTP requests in the terminal.
- Colorized and formatted output for easy reading.
- Session persistence for handling cookies and other authentication.

HTTPie also offers a paid tier for businesses, with a GUI and team collaboration features, diverging
from the core CLI philosophy.

## Hoppscotch: The browser-based API client

[Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.com/) is a completely browser-based API client that runs as a PWA 
(Progressive Web App) in the browser and is not far behind when comapred to Postman in terms of the 
feature set. It supports various API types (like REST, SOAP, GraphQL), including real-time APIs 
(like WebSocket, Socket.io & MQTT). It even recently released a desktop application of the API 
client, offering the same browser-based experience on a desktop app (probably using Electron)

### Features

- A friendly UI for sending requests and inspecting responses.
- Organises requests into **Collections** for better collaboration & reusability.
- **Environments** for storing and sharing environment variables with the team via the cloud.
- Real-time collaboration using **Hoppscotch Cloud**, with team workspaces for sharing collections
  and environments.
- **Migration** supports importing and exporting Postman & cURL files.

Just like Postman, Hoppscotch also has a centralised cloud-first platform, however it also supports
[self-hosting](https://docs.hoppscotch.io/documentation/self-host/getting-started).

## Bruno: The modern open-source API client

[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) attempts to disrupt the status quo with a powerful 
[manifesto](https://docs.usebruno.com/introduction/manifesto), and a team that's trying to tackle
the exact pain points that make Postman & Hoppscotch hard to work with: vendor lock-in, bloatware,
and proprietary cloud-based platforms. Bruno claims to be a developer-first and extensible platform,
where 'platform' features are non-goals. It is offline-first (yes!), where data isn't automatically
synced to any cloud, and it has native git integration, which simplifies collaboration between
developers (since most developers are already familiar with git as a distributed version control
and collaboration tool).

### Features

Of course, the real picture of Bruno is that it's still catching up. Its only major drawback is that
it just supports REST and GraphQL, with no support for real-time APIs yet.

- A friendly UI for sending requests and inspecting responses.
- **Collections** are first-class citizens, that help organise requests and documentation for 
  better collaboration and reuse. Requests and documentation are stored as files in 
  [Bru Markup](https://docs.usebruno.com/bru-lang/overview), and collections map the folder 
  structure of the project.
- **Offline-first**, no file is automatically synced to any cloud, and 
  [native git integration](https://docs.usebruno.com/git-integration/overview) allows developers to
  collaborate via [git](https://git-scm.com/), a distributed version control system.
- [Scripting](https://docs.usebruno.com/testing/script/getting-started) support in JavaScript, for
  [testing](https://docs.usebruno.com/testing/tests/introduction) and **dynamic requests**.
- [Secrets management](https://docs.usebruno.com/secrets-management/overview) with environment 
  variables within the API client.

The killer feature of course is the git-based collaboration, since this enables 
[GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) for API collections, which means each git branch
can have different versions, and these can be merged, or even reviewed via PRs (Pull Requests). 
Bruno is also completely free & open source. 

## Choosing the Right Tool

Choose Bruno if: 
- Your team heavily relies on Git for version control.
- You prefer open-source and free tools.
- Offline functionality and data privacy are priorities.
- You want a lightweight and fast API client with GitOps workflow for API collections.

Choose Postman if: 
- Your team needs a comprehensive API platform with extensive features across the API lifecycle.
- Cloud-based collaboration and API lifecycle management are essential.
- You require advanced testing, documentation, mocking, and monitoring capabilities.
- You are comfortable with a freemium model and a cloud-centric approach.

Choose Hoppscotch if: 
- You need a simple, web-based API client accessible from any browser.
- Real-time collaboration and ease of sharing are important.
- You prefer open-source and free tools with optional cloud features.
- Quick API testing and exploration are primary use cases.

Choose HTTPie (CLI) if: 
- You are comfortable with the command line and prefer CLI-based workflows.
- Scripting, automation, and quick ad-hoc requests from the terminal are common tasks.
- Simplicity and readability in the terminal are prioritized.
- GUI is not a requirement, and you prefer a lightweight, fast, and efficient tool for 
  terminal-based API interaction.

## Migration Considerations

### Bruno & Hoppscotch support Postman collection import
Both Bruno & Hoppscotch make it relatively easy to import Postman collections. It also supports 
importing environment variables in most cases.

### Consider Bru lang for Bruno manual optimisation
Bruno uses Bru, a human readable, plain text markup language that’s git friendly too. This allows
us to optimize collections for Bruno’s Git-based workflows if migrating to Bruno.

### HTTPie is a different paradigm
Migration to HTTPie from GUI clients means adopting a CLI-based workflow. This could be 
counter-productive in most situations and potentially require major rewrites.

## Conclusion

We use API clients to effectively call and test APIs. They simplify complex tasks, boost 
productivity, and are essential for exploring, testing and even debugging new APIs. The API 
client landscape is as diverse as the variety of APIs and technologies, and each tool supports 
various needs. Ultimately, tool selection depends heavily on specific team needs and workflow 
preferences. Consider factors like collaboration style, budget, API types, privacy needs, and 
CLI vs. GUI preference.
