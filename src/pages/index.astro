    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Driven by my desire to solve world problems (and my problems), my passion for software 
      and engineering. I tinker mainly in Go and NodeJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my first job I worked closely with experienced engineers from Nokia. I was 
      responsible for maintaining and improving their core backend infrastructure, 
      written in Go. My efforts resulted in a reduction in 5xx error codes and a 
      33% decrease in customer complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a freelancer, I've successfully built and delivered multiple projects for national 
      and international clients, honing my full-stack development skills with a strong emphasis 
      on backend engineering. I have a solid foundation in Node.js, Go, and Next.js, and I'm 
      proficient in designing and building scalable APIs using GraphQL, REST, and tRPC. I'm 
      a quick learner with a strong problem-solving ability and a track record of delivering 
      high-quality software. I'm eager to contribute my skills to a challenging SDE2 role 
      where I can contribute to the design, development, and deployment of software products.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to building and designing microservices, I'm relentless about
      reducing vendor lock-in while offering simplicity, maintainability, 
      and performance. I'm a strong advocate of DRY principles and design patterns, 
      ensuring my code is secure, well-documented, and maintainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm constantly learning and exploring new stuff to improve my craft and
      contribute to a better future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my professional endeavors, I have also been an independent
      researcher. Collaborating with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology_Goa"
        >NIT Goa</a
      >, we delved into the design, analysis, and applications of ternary logic
      gates. It's published on <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yash-Diniz-2">ResearchGate</a
      >.

    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <p>
      I am addicted to learning and continuously discovering new things, and I
      love the thrill and joy of building new applications. I tend to choose 
      this sometimes over food, sleep, and even hygiene.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do have difficulty delegating tasks. I need to get to know you well before 
      I can work with you, so I guess that's a good thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      I normally tend to over-explain and provide detailed and descriptive
      answers for any question asked. Friends used to call me a college
      professor who explained stuff really well ;) Being brief is something I've
      been working on.
