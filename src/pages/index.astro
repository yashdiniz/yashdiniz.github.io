    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Driven by my desire to solve world problems (and my problems) through
      technology, I leverage my passion for software, engineering, and systems
      architecture. I tinker mainly in Go and NodeJS, and I'm also Tech Lead at
      Team Velocilabs, creators of Spyke Social and other products.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise lies in building and designing microservices deployed using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-native_computing"
        >cloud-native solutions</a
      > (like Docker & Kubernetes), with a relentless focus on reducing vendor
      lock-in while offering simplicity, maintainability, and performance. I'm a
      strong advocate of DRY principles and design patterns, ensuring my code is
      secure, well-documented, and easy to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my coding skills, I have a deep interest in systems design, machine
      intelligence, IoT, and data engineering. I'm constantly learning and
      exploring new technologies and methodologies to improve my craft and
      contribute to a better future.

    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <p>
      I am addicted to learning and continuously discovering new things, and I
      love to experience the thrill and joy of building new applications. I tend
      to choose this sometimes over food, sleep, and even hygiene. Recently
      discovered energy management, and that really vibed with the way I
      operate, maybe it's better than time management?
    </p>
    <p>
      I do have difficulty delegating tasks, been working on building trust and
      collaboration. I need to get to know you well before I can collaborate
      with you, so I guess that's a good thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      I normally tend to over-explain and provide detailed and descriptive
      answers for any question asked. Friends used to call me a college
      professor who explained stuff really well ;) Being brief is something I've
      been working on.
