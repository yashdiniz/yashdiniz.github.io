    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a backend engineer with over 4 years of experience in full-stack
      development, specializing in Go and Node.js. My recent work has centered
      on DevOps practices, optimizing deployments and infrastructure. I've
      contributed to diverse projects in IoT/Building Automation, Digital Media
      Platforms, and Asset Management, consistently prioritizing clean,
      maintainable, and scalable architectures that drive real impact.
    </p>
    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://bluealtair.com">Blue Altair</a>, I developed and
      deployed MLOps workflows on Databricks (MLFlow), covering feature
      preparation, model training and production-grade inference. I also
      designed and implemented cross-system business process automation using
      platforms such as Workato and n8n.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://velocilabs.com">Velocilabs</a>, I designed and built
      the core backend infrastructure for a social media platform, <a
        href="https://spyke.social">Spyke</a
      >, using GraphQL, Go, PostgreSQL, and other technologies, which boosted
      data fetching efficiency by 40%, enabling the frontend team to iterate
      rapidly and deliver features faster. I also slashed operational costs by
      50% through cloud strategy optimization and upgraded deployment strategies
      for reactive scaling and peak performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://spintly.com">Spintly</a> I built APIs for their Building
      Automation and IoT platform. I refactored core microservices using Saga patterns
      to improve stability and cut customer complaints by 33%. I also developed and
      maintained Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to automate the containerization and deployment
      of microservices. This effort reduced server and infrastructure errors by an
      impressive 66% over 8 months.
    </p>
    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>FOCUSA Remind</strong> (2025): An open-source Telegram and Slack bot
      for creating and managing personal reminders, including support for recurring
      schedules using RRULE. It uses natural language commands (e.g., "Remind me
      to buy milk at 6pm" or "Remind me to call mom every Monday at 9am") to schedule
      reminders, which are delivered via the bots. The project is built with Next.js
      15, Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL database management, and Grammy for Telegram
      bot functionality. It's hosted on Vercel and integrates Vercel's AI SDK for
      enhanced processing. <a href="https://github.com/yashdiniz/focusa-remind"

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Green I</strong> (2024): A geo-location app that rewards users
      for supporting local eco-friendly businesses, and also manages rewards through
      QR codes. Built the backend with Next.js serverless and NeonDB (PostgreSQL).
      <a href="https://the-green-i.vercel.app">View Project</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>OGPScraper</strong> (2023): A lightweight server written in Go that
      scrapes OpenGraph metadata (like titles, descriptions, images, and URLs) from
      websites. It includes caching functionality to handle repeat requests efficiently,
      reducing redundant scraping. <a
        href="https://github.com/yashdiniz/ogpscraper">GitHub</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>DearJarvis</strong> (2020): A web application developed for the <a
        href="https://devfolio.co/projects/DearJarvis"
        >HackByTheBeach2020 hackathon</a
      > to help users assess their mental wellbeing through journal analysis. It
      integrates with note-taking apps like Google Keep to scan and analyze journal
      entries, providing insights such as mood graphs over time, factors that cause
      happiness or sadness, desired activities, and tasks to complete. The app emphasizes
      a seamless writing experience while offering organized insights from past notes.

    <h3>Current Interests</h3>
    <p>
      I'm always evolving — currently exploring geo-location application
      development, and Apigee for API management.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my professional endeavors, I have also been an independent
      researcher who has published multiple papers. Collaborating with <a

        >NIT Goa</a
      >, we delved into the design, analysis, and applications of ternary logic
      gates. We also published a paper on High Capacity Conduits (HCCs) and
      Interface Bottlenecking, both available to read on <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yash-Diniz-2">ResearchGate</a
      >.
