    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am determined about solving the world's problems through my skills. Have
      built nodeJS/expressJS servers, and recently completed projects in Go.
      Passionate about how to optimize code to improve performance, hence prefer
      minimalistic and simple solutions for both the user and developer.
      Advocate of DRY, using design patterns to make code maintainable. Ready to
      trade DRY for maintainable code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I consider Security equally important, and strive to ensure that the
      software I design and help build is as secure as I can make it. Always
      interested in system design, machine intelligence, IoT and data analytics.
      Good at documentation. Prefer modularity in coding and micro-service
      architectures.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some projects I've worked on. FOCUSA, ASMDV, QMjs, NPWS, FRUI,
      Some Parking Solution Hobbies include reading, learning, coding, and
      documentation. I prefer being the one who works behind the scenes, not
      entering the limelight, changing one life at a time. Other recent
      interests include GraphQL, pouchDB & couchDB, Promises, oneM2M and
      participating in hackathons. Currently a software architect at Spyke
      Social.
    </p>
    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
    <p>
      DearJarvis Helped organise hackathons like debuggerX and Inspirathon.
      Participated at the Smart Panaji Hackathon 2020 and proposed this solution
      for the Smart Mobility Challenge. Reached the quarter-finals of the IICDC
      2019.
    </p>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <p>
      I believed that databases were really inefficient and slow, and just too
      complex at attempting to be an all-in-one solution and failing miserably.
      Thus, I had created my own doc-store using nodeJS, which gave the server a
      huge performance boost. While mine isn't public yet due to long term
      performance issues, CouchDB caters to everything my implementation suffers
      from, but better. I am addicted to learning and continuously discovering
      new things, and I love to experience the thrill and joy of building new
      applications. I tend to choose this sometimes over food, sleep, and even
      hygiene. I am working on my time management. Recently discovered energy
      management, and that really vibed with the way I operate. I normally like
      to explain a lot and provide detailed descriptions for any question asked.
      Being brief is something I've been working on.
