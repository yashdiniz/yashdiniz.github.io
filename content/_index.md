## About Me

I am determined about solving the world's problems through my skills. 
Have built nodeJS/expressJS servers, and recently completed projects in Go. 
Passionate about how to optimize code to improve performance, hence prefer minimalistic and simple solutions for both the user and developer. 
Advocate of DRY, using design patterns to make code maintainable. 
Ready to trade DRY for maintainable code.

I consider Security equally important, and strive to ensure that the software I design and help build is as secure as I can make it. 
Always interested in system design, machine intelligence, IoT and data analytics. 
Good at documentation. 
Prefer modularity in coding and micro-service architectures.

## Caveats

I believed that databases were really inefficient and slow, and just too complex at attempting to be an all-in-one solution and failing miserably. 
Thus, I had created my own doc-store using nodeJS, which gave the server a huge performance boost. 
While mine isn't public yet due to long term performance issues, CouchDB caters to everything my implementation suffers from, but better.

I am addicted to learning and continuously discovering new things, and I love to experience the thrill and joy of building new applications. 
I tend to choose this sometimes over food, sleep, and even hygiene. 
I am working on my time management. 
Recently discovered energy management, and that really vibed with the way I operate.

I normally like to explain a lot and provide detailed descriptions for any question asked. 
Being brief is something I've been working on.
