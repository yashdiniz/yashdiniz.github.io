# README: Astro

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

I've decided to go with the following project structure, inspired by [the Frontend Handbook](https://infinum.com/handbook/frontend/react/project-structure).

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ascii.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ global.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
